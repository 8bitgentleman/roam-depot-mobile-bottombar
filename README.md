An extension to add custom buttons to the bottom bar of Roam on mobile (both the app and through a mobile web browser). Buttons included are:
- Toggle Block open/closed
    - Have difficulty opening and closing blocks on mobile? Select a block and hit this button to make it easy.
- Trigger SmartBlock Workflow
    - Have a custom smartblocks workflow you'd like to use on mobile? Trigger it with a custom button for ease of access.

If you have an idea for a new button let me know!
